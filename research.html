  <h2>
    Currently a member of <a href="https://mattia-lab.com/">Gazzola Lab</a>. 
    My current research revolves around using computational methods to model and
    understand slender soft body systems. I am interested in using these methods 
    for designing soft robot actuators and developing control frameworks to 
    control soft robots in complex environments. Below are some highlights of
    my work.

<div class="content">
  <h2>
    Materials that expand anisotropically can be used to make coiled muscles that reversibly untwist
    when heated/chemically actuated. These types of have several advantages that make interesting for
    robotic applications. These advantages include the following:
    <ul>
      <li> Being easy and inexpensive to manufacture </li>
      <li> Operate without hysteresis </li>
      <li> Provide more than 30% reversible contraction </li>
      <li> Provide millions of cycles of stroke without significant degradation </li>
    </ul>
    Below is an example of these muscles in action. I developed a model for the actuation of these muscles
    and used our simulator <a href="https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica">PyElastica</a> to simulate 
    the actuation of single fiber muscle. We work closely with the <a href="https://tawfick.mechse.illinois.edu/">kinetic Materials Research Group</a>
    who manufacture these muscles and provides us with experimental data to validate our models.

    I am also working on using the muscle models I developed to design different mechanisms using
    the coiled artifical muscles for various applications. Here's an example of using these muscles as a
    an actuator to bend and twist an octopus arm.

    Here's another example of the muscles being used in antagonstic arrangment that is analogous to
    the bicep and tricep in a human arm. For the example shown below I had to extended the capability
    of our simulator PyElastica to be able to handle triangluar mesh based rigid bodies and surfaces.

  <h2>
    One of the other applications of hte new triangluar mesh based surfaces import capability I developed was to use it
    to test out some RL based control strategies for limbless soft robot navigation our team has been working on. Shown below
    are some examples of these control strategies being used on reconstructed real environments.
